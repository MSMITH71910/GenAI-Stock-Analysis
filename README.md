# GenAI-Stock-Analysis

## I successfully completed the "Zero to Mastery - GenAI for Stock Portfolio" project, where I utilized multiple tools and technologies, including Python, OpenAI's GPT models, and LangChain. The project was developed in Google Colab, showcasing my ability to integrate advanced AI frameworks and tools to create a functional and efficient stock portfolio analyzer.

  ## Built the AI Stock Analyzer

1. Developed an AI application that can:
   Analyze stock data.

2. Provide insights into portfolio optimization.
   
3. Use GPT models to generate natural language explanations of financial data.
   
  ## Integration with LangChain
  
1. Use LangChain to enhance the AI's ability to process and analyze financial data.
   
2. Implement LangChain's tools to manage workflows, retrieve relevant data, and improve the AI's contextual understanding.
   
  ## Practical Implementation
 
Write Python code to integrate GPT models with LangChain for stock analysis.
Build a user-friendly interface for the AI stock analyzer, potentially using frameworks like Streamlit for visualization.
Step 6: Portfolio Optimization
Apply portfolio optimization theories to suggest the best investment strategies.
Use AI to simulate and evaluate different portfolio configurations based on user inputs 

  ## Finalizing and Testing
  
Test the AI stock analyzer with real-world stock data.
Refine the application to ensure accuracy and usability.
